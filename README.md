## Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of my data science skills and a place to showcase the projects I've worked on. The projects cover a range of topics and utilize various data science tools and techniques, including (but not limited to):

* **Data Analysis and Exploration:** Techniques for understanding and summarizing datasets.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating informative and insightful visual representations of data.
* **Machine Learning:** Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
* **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):** Utilizing frameworks for efficient model building.
* **Model Interpretability:** Understanding and explaining the predictions of machine learning models.

## Getting Started

This section outlines the general steps to get started with exploring the projects in this repository. Specific instructions for individual projects might be found in their respective README files.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in these projects, you might need to have the following software installed on your system:

* **Python 3.x:** The primary programming language used.
* **pip:** Python package installer.
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (Optional but recommended):** For running and interacting with the notebooks.

You may also need to install specific Python libraries depending on the project. These dependencies are usually listed in a `requirements.txt` file within each project directory.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/SathwikHegde/data-science-projects.git)
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies for a specific project:**
    Navigate to the project's directory (e.g., `cd American-Express-Default-Prediction`) and install the required libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If a `requirements.txt` file exists in that project's directory.)

## Usage

To run the code for a specific project:

1.  Navigate to the project's directory.
2.  Look for a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) or a Python script (`.py` file) that serves as the main entry point for the project.
3.  **For Jupyter Notebooks:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook  # Or jupyter lab
    ```
    Then, open the desired notebook in your browser and run the cells.
4.  **For Python scripts:**
    ```bash
    python main_script.py  # Replace 'main_script.py' with the actual script name
    ```

Refer to the individual project's README file for more detailed instructions and explanations.

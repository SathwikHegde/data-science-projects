# Employee Future Prediction using AutoML

## Overview

This project predicts the **future employment status of employees** using an **AutoML framework**. The goal is to analyze employee-related attributes and identify factors contributing to their potential resignation or retention. The project leverages the power of automated machine learning for optimal model selection and tuning.

---

## Objective

Predict whether an employee is likely to leave or continue working at a company based on historical employee data, including attributes such as:

- Age
- Department
- Salary
- Tenure
- Job Satisfaction
- Work-life balance
- Promotion history
- Performance ratings

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- AutoML Framework (PyCaret or H2O AutoML)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Categorical encoding
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand employee patterns

---

## Modeling

- Leveraged **AutoML** to automatically select the best-performing model
- Compared results across multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
  - AUC Score

---

## Results

- AutoML framework selected the best model based on validation performance
- Identified key drivers for employee attrition
- Model helps HR departments proactively identify potential resignations
